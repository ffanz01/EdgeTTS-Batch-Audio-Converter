A woman goes to the doctor, worried about her husband's temper. The doctor asks: "What's the problem?" The woman says: "Doctor, I don't know what to do. Every day my husband seems to lose his temper for no reason. It scares me." The doctor says: "I have a cure for that. When it happens again, just take a glass of water and start swishing it around in your mouth. Don't swallow until he calms down." The woman thanks the doctor and goes home. That evening, the husband comes home from work in a really bad mood. He starts yelling at her for no reason. She quickly grabs a glass of water and starts swishing it around in her mouth. The husband yells: "Are you chewing on something?" She shakes her head no, but continues swishing the water. The husband gets even angrier and screams: "Well, spit it out!" So she does - right in his face.
